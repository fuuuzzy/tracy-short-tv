        Creators should only upload movies that they have made or are authorized to use. This means they
        should
        not upload movies that they did not make themselves without the necessary authorization, or use
        content
        in their movies that others have copyrighted, such as music tracks, copyrighted program clips,
        or movies
        made by other users.

      <div class="secTitle">What are copyright exceptions?</div>
      <div class="content">
        A copyright exception is a special case in the law that allows others to use the copyrighted
        work of the
        copyright owner without the consent of the other party, provided that certain conditions are
        met.
        <br>
        In the US, the most well-known copyright exception is Fair Use. When deciding whether to meet
        the fair
        use standard, courts consider four factors: the purpose and characteristics of the use, the
        nature of
        the copyrighted work, the overall proportion and importance of the use in the copyrighted work,
        and the
        impact of repeated use on the addressable market and value of the copyrighted work. Conduct that
        may
        qualify for Fair Use includes criticism, commentary, and news reporting. Fair use is designed to
        protect
        freedom of expression.
        <br><br>
        Some civil law countries, including many in the European Union, have stricter rules for
        copyright
        exceptions, allowing only certain categories of content to reuse copyrighted works without
        weighing
        various factors. Article 17 of the European Union's Digital Single Market copyright directive
        defines
        these categories as citations, criticisms, comments, satire, parodies and imitations. These
        terms have a
        fixed meaning in everyday language, but are also used to make laws in member states and are
        interpreted
        individually by national courts and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The
        context of
        reuse and the purpose of the copyright exception must also be considered. One of the key
        considerations
        is to balance the freedom of expression of the creator with the copyright of the copyright
        owner.
        <br><br>
        In some countries, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia, a hybrid concept called
        "Fair
        Dealing" is adopted. Courts will assess the weight of various factors based on a principle that
        approximates fair use, but this norm also only allows the reuse of copyrighted works for certain
        categories of content. These categories include citations (general citations, as well as
        citations for
        criticism, commentary, and news reporting), satire, parody, and imitation.
        <br><br>
        Most countries around the world have signed the Berne Convention, an international treaty that
        allows
        copyrighted works to be reused for certain categories of content, including citations and news
        reports.
        <br><br>
        Although there are some similarities in the practice of copyright exceptions around the world,
        there are
        still considerable differences in national laws. There is no uniform answer as to whether a
        particular
        case of reuse is a copyright exception. Courts will decide whether copyright exceptions apply on
        a
        case-by-case basis.
        <br><br>
        Short.ibrave's mission is to give everyone a voice on the world stage. Copyright exceptions
        allow for
        the free exchange and development of ideas and ideas, and are therefore essential to advancing
        this
        mission. Therefore, we urge copyright owners to consider whether the copyright exception is
        applicable
        to the current situation before making a copyright removal request. We believe this will balance
        the
        rights of copyright owners and creators, respect copyright owners, and protect creators' freedom
        of
        expression protected by copyright exceptions.
        <br><br>
        In addition, we've designed products that help creators access, create, and share information in
        unprecedented ways. We've created a music library that makes it easy for users to find free,
        high-quality music and sound effects that can be easily reused. With short.ibrave Shorts, you
        can now
        sample other people's content to shoot short films, provided they agree. We'll also continue to
        develop
        and expand creator music so that creators participating in the short.ibrave partner program can
        safely
        use commercial music through soundtrack licensing and sharing video proceeds with music
        copyright
        owners.

      <div class="secTitle">How can a copyright owner file a copyright claim?</div>
      <div class="content">Short.ibrave copyright management tools allow copyright owners to manage their
        copyrighted content on short.ibrave and make it available to everyone. We work with copyright
        owners to
        identify features that work for them based on several criteria, including how much copyrighted
        content
        they have on short.ibrave and how much resources they invest in responsibly managing their
        online
        content. The portfolio of copyright management tools provides copyright owners with multiple
        ways to
        make copyright claims.
      </div>
      <div class="secTitle">web form</div>
      <div class="content">The easiest way to remove unauthorized copying of copyrighted content is to
        submit a
        copyright notice through the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) web form. This is best
        practice for
        most people because not only is it available to everyone, but all languages are supported.
      </div>
      <div class="secTitle">Copyright Match Tool</div>
      <div class="content">The Copyright Match Tool uses powerful Content ID matching technology to
        identify
        re-uploaded videos on short.ibrave. This tool works on more than 1.5 million channels, finding
        re-uploads that are nearly identical to the creator's original videos in other short.ibrave
        channels,
        and allowing the creator to choose what action to take, such as requesting removal of
        re-uploaded videos
        or sending a message to the video uploader. If the creator does not want to take any action, the
        comparison results can also be directly sealed. Anyone who has successfully performed DMCA
        removal
        through a web form can use our public form to apply for the right to use this tool.
      </div>
      <div class="secTitle">Content ID</div>
      <div class="content">Content ID helps copyright owners deal with complex copyright issues. Content
        ID is
        our digital fingerprinting system that allows copyright owners to upload copyrighted content as
        a
        reference file, and then the system scans other videos uploaded to short.ibrave to see if they
        contain
        the same content. After the user uploads the content, Content ID scans the database for matching
        videos.
        When Content ID detects matching content, it takes action according to the rules or policies
        predefined
        by the content owner:
        <br><br>
        Block the entire video so that no one can watch it. If the content owner blocks the video, the
        creator
        will not receive a copyright warning.
        <br><br>
        Advertise in videos for profit; in some cases, share the proceeds with the uploader. * Track
        video
        diving-related statistics.
        <br><br>
        In most cases, this means that the copyright owner does not have to file a notice of
        infringement
        against these films, but instead allows the films to remain on the short.ibrave platform in
        exchange for
        the sale of advertising profits.
      </div>
      <div class="secTitle">What actions will short.ibrave take against copyright infringement?</div>
      <div class="content">If a copyright owner submits a valid Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)
        complaint
        through an online form, we will remove the video under complaint and issue a copyright warning.
        If a
        user receives three copyright warnings within 90 days, the system will terminate the user's
        account and
        all associated channels. We also provide creators with ways to remove copyright warnings,
        including
        waiting for the copyright warning to automatically expire after 90 days, asking for the warning
        to be
        revoked, or submitting a response notice.
        <br><br>
        Content ID works differently. This mechanism issues a "copyright notice" when a newly uploaded
        video is
        found to match a reference file. We track videos, monetize videos, or block videos according to
        the
        preferences selected by the Content ID owner, but do not issue copyright warnings.
