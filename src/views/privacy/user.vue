        Change this Agreement
        <br>
        We may change this Agreement for various purposes, such as (1) to reflect changes in the
        Services or the
        way we do business (e.g., when we add new products/features or remove old ones), (2) for legal,
        regulatory or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.<br>
        If we make material changes to this Agreement, we will notify you in advance at a reasonable
        time and
        give you the opportunity to rediv the changes, except in the following circumstances: (1) when
        we
        release new products or features, or (2) in the event of an emergency (such as to combat ongoing
        abuse
        or respond to legal requirements). If you do not want to accept the new terms, you should remove
        the
        content you uploaded and stop using this service.
        <br><br>
        Continuation of this Agreement<br>

        Separability<br>
        If a particular provision of this Agreement is unenforceable for any reason, this will not
        affect any
        other provisions.<br>
        Does not constitute an automatic waiver<br>
        If you fail to comply with this Agreement and we do not take immediate action, this does not
        mean that
        we waive any rights we may have (such as the right to take action in the future).
        <br><br>
        Explanation<br>
        In the above terms, "including" means "including but not limited to", and the examples we
        provide are
        for illustrative purposes only.
