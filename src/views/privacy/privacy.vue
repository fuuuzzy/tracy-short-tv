        Many of our services allow you to share information with others, and you can control how you
        share it.
        For example, you can share videos publicly on short.ibrave or set them as private. Please note
        that if
        you share information publicly, others may be able to access your content through search engines
        (including short.ibrave search).<br>
        After logging in to your account, if you interact with certain short.ibrave services (such as
        commenting
        on short.ibrave videos or rating apps in Play), your name and photo will appear next to the
        corresponding activity. We may also display this information in advertisements based on your
        "Share
        Recognition" settings.

      <div class="secTitle">Overdiv of user-generated content</div>
      <div class="secTitle">What is user-generated content?</div>
      <div class="content">
        For applications or websites, user-generated content refers to the content submitted by users to
        any
        application or website. At least some users of these applications or websites can see such
        content.
        User-generated content includes text, comments, images, videos, profiles, usernames, polls,
        likes,
        hearts,
        or other media. Advertisements are not considered user-generated content unless they contain
        embedded
        social
        media.
      </div>
      <div class="secTitle">What responsibility do I have for user-generated content?</div>
      <div class="content">
        As a publisher, you are responsible for ensuring that all user-generated content on your website
        or app
        complies with all applicable collaboration standards. In fact, this means that to join the
        AdSense
        and/or
        AdMob programs, you need to ensure that all content on pages with embedded ad codes (including
        user-generated content) complies with all applicable collaboration standards.
      </div>
      <div class="secTitle">How is user-generated content different from my other content?</div>
      <div class="content">
        Unlike other content that may be created directly under your guidance and supervision,
        user-generated
        content is submitted by users who independently operate on your website or application.
        Unfortunately,
        not
        all internet users are polite and well-behaved. As users can post any content, as a publisher,
        you need
        to
        be prepared to ensure that the content they post complies with all applicable cooperation
        standards.
